# EATGF Governance Portal

The Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF) provides a comprehensive, standards-aligned governance architecture for organizations implementing IT, AI, and cloud governance.

## Framework Structure

The EATGF framework is organized across 8 governance layers:

| Layer | Name                    | Purpose                                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00    | Foundation              | Master Control Matrix, document standards, baseline declarations          |
| 01    | Management Systems      | ISMS and AIMS implementation guidance                                     |
| 02    | Control Architecture    | Control objectives, risk framework, framework mappings                    |
| 03    | Governance Models       | Maturity models, team-size-based governance                               |
| 04    | Policy Layer            | Enterprise policies (security, privacy, incident response, BCP)           |
| 05    | Domain Frameworks       | AI, API, and cloud domain-specific governance                             |
| 06    | Audit and Assurance     | Audit scheduling, evidence governance, corrective action                  |
| 07    | Reference and Evolution | Historical artifacts, decision records, roadmap                           |
| 08    | Developer Governance    | SDLC, API governance, DevSecOps, infrastructure runtime, cloud, lifecycle |

## Standards Alignment

EATGF maps to ISO 27001:2022, ISO 42001:2023, NIST SP 800-218, COBIT 2019, and OWASP ASVS/SAMM.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the [Framework](/framework) section to explore the governance documentation.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at <http://localhost:3000/>.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
